# S1T5 — Java Utils

This unit focuses on **Java I/O and Serialization**, covering directory manipulation, recursive file listing, and the persistence of objects using the `Serializable` interface.

## TASK 1 - LEVEL 1

### 📌 Exercise 1 — Alphabetical Directory Listing
Create a class that lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order.

### 📌 Exercise 2 — Recursive Tree Listing
Extend the functionality to list the entire directory tree recursively, showing subfolders and files sorted alphabetically with their last modification dates.

### 📌 Exercise 3 — Output to File
Modify the previous exercise so the resulting directory tree is saved directly into a `.txt` file instead of the console.

### 📌 Exercise 4 — File Reader
Implement a method to read the content of any `.txt` file and print its content to the terminal.

### 📌 Exercise 5 — Serialization & Deserialization
Demonstrate how to serialize a `Book` object into a `.ser` file and then deserialize it to verify the object’s state is recovered.
